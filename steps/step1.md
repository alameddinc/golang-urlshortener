```bash
mkdir -p {cmd,deployment,internal/{shorturl,userservice}/{domain,service,handler,repository},pkg/{db,cache,logger}}
```

The following directory structure is a commonly used structure for organizing Go projects:

```bash
├── cmd
├── deployment
├── internal
│   ├── shorturl
│   │   ├── domain
│   │   ├── handler
│   │   ├── repository
│   │   └── service
│   └── userservice
│       ├── domain
│       ├── handler
│       ├── repository
│       └── service
└── pkg
├── cache
├── db
└── logger
```

* cmd: This directory holds the main entry points for the application.
* deployment: This directory holds the configuration files and deployment scripts.
* internal: This directory holds the internal components of the project.
* shorturl: This directory holds the files related to short URLs.
* domain: This directory holds the data models and business logic codes.
* handler: This directory holds the request routing functions.
* repository: This directory holds the database access functions.
* service: This directory holds the server-side codes.
* userservice: This directory holds the files related to user service.
* domain: This directory holds the data models and business logic codes.
* handler: This directory holds the request routing functions.
* repository: This directory holds the database access functions.
* service: This directory holds the server-side codes.
* pkg: This directory holds the packages of the project.
* cache: This directory holds the files related to caching functions.
* db: This directory holds the files related to database connection.
* logger: This directory holds the files related to logging functions.

**Note**:  This directory structure is commonly used for organizing Go projects, and it can help improve the readability
and maintainability of the codebase.
